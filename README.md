# CreateMapArt
R codes adapted from https://github.com/erdavis1/RoadColors and modified for my personal use.\
Codes create map art with coloured road networks for any regions based on the shapefiles downloaded from OpenStreetMap Data Extracts (http://download.geofabrik.de/).\
The code will select the top 8 road suffix/prefix based on the total length of each road suffix type. Then it will plot and colour code each road suffix/prefix type.
